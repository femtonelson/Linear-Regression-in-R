# Multi-Linear-Regression
* Data source : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tuyenhavan/Statistics/Dataset/50-Startups.csv
* Working Environment : RStudio 1.2.5001
* The dataset contains 50 observations of 5 variables : Spending on R&D, Administration, Marketing, the State (New York, California, Florida) in which the Startup is based and the Profit generated by the Startup.

# Objective : Attempt a prediction of a startup's profitability based on its spending and the State.

#The above matrix suggests Profit is strongly and positively correlated with Marketing and R&D spending.
#Administration spending however shows low correlation with other variables and as such is not likely to affect Profit. To be confirmed.

Residual standard error: 9439 on 44 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.9508,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.9452 
F-statistic: 169.9 on 5 and 44 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16

#The above summary shows :
#1-Considering a multiple linear model is a good idea since the Adjusted R-squared and Multiple R-squared are close to 1.
#2-The p-values associated with factors StateFlorida & StateNew York are high >95% (the reference for the T test is California). This is in accordance with the AOV test performed earlier.
#2-Therefore we accept the null hypothesis : There is no difference between the influence of Florida compared to California,the influence of New York compared to California & furthermore no influence of the State in which the Startup is located on its profitability.
#3-The low p-value (<2e-16) of the T test on R.D.Spend suggests this variable has an influence on the Profit (null hypothesis rejected).
#4-Administration and Marketing.Spend have high p-values (12% & 60%) which suggest these variables have no influence on Profit. To be confirmed in variable selection procedure.
